How components are created

-> include/y2/Y2ComponentCreator.h

The Y2ComponentCreator class is the interface between
a component and the component broker (Y2ComponentBroker.cc).
It is used to find and intialize a component, it is not used
for communication with a component.

The component broker keeps a global list of all known components.

Y2ComponentCreator(Y2ComponentBroker::order_t order);
  enters the component to the broker's list in the given order.

Y2Component *create(const char *name) const
  create the component and return a handle for communication
  (see interface.txt)
  name is used to identify components based on the same code
  (e.g. stdio and stderr)

Y2Component *create(const char *name, int level, int current_level)
  same as above, but for external components which may reside
  in different directories. The level identifies the directory prefix
  from the list defined in pathsearch.cc

bool isServerCreator() const
  return true for servers, false for clients.

bool isClientCreator()
