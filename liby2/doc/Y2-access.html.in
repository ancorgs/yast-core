YaST2: How to access hardware and configuration files

There are a number of different ways to access configuration files,
the output of external programms and the hardware from within YCP
scripts.

<ul>
      <li>Write an <b>SCR agent</b> in YCP using the <b>anyagent</b> component.
      <li>Write an <b>SCR agent</b>, either in C++ or in shell</li>
      <li>Use the WFM builtin <b><tt>Shell()</tt></b> to call a shell
	script</li>
      <li>Use the WFM builtins <b><tt>ReadString()</tt> and <tt>WriteString()</tt></b>
	to read and write Ascii files directly</li>
      <li>Write a </b>client component</b> in C++ that calls an external program and
	parses its output. Use the liby2 class <tt>ExternalProgramm</tt> for
	this.
      </li>
      <li>Write a arbitrary <b>server component</b> in C++ and implement there the functionality
	you need.</li>
</ul>


All methods have advantages and disadvantages. The upper list is
ordered in the direction in which you have to decide. For example if
something can be done with the <tt>anyagent</tt>, you should do it
this way. If not, try to write an agent in C++ or in shell. The
advantage of agents is, that they are very independent of the
configuration module(s) that use them. It is much more easy to reuse
an agent than a code sequence of a module.
