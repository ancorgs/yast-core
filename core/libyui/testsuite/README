YCP testsuite

The ycp testsuite test the libycp by running all .ycp files in
the ycp.test directory (tests/*.ycp) through runycp.

Every run results in a stdout and stderr output which is
checked agains .out and .err respectively.

The file lib/ycp.exp defines a function which runs all tests
contained in tests (i.e. makes a 'glob' on tests/*.ycp)

For every .ycp file you put in tests, you must create the proper
.out and .err file with the following command

runycp < file.ycp > file.out 2> file.err
