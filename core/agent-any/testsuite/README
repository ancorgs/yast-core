ag_anyagent testsuite

The ag_anyagent testsuite test the anyagent by running
all ".ycp" files in the tests directory ("tests/*.ycp")
through runag_anyagent. The program runag_anyagent also
looks for a file with the same name but the ending
".scr" and passes its contents to the agent.

Every run results in a stdout and stderr output which
is checked agains ".out" and ".err" respectively.

The file lib/ag_anyagent_init.exp defines a function
which runs all tests contained in tests (i.e. makes a
'glob' on "tests/*.ycp").

For every ".ycp" file you put in tests, you must create
the proper ".out" and ".err" files.
