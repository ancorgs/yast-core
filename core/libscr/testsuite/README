SCR testsuite

The scr testsuite test the libscr by running all .scr files in
the scr.test directory (tests/*.scr) through runscr.

Every run results in a stdout and stderr output which is
checked agains .out and .err respectively.

The file lib/scr.exp defines a function which runs all tests
contained in tests (i.e. makes a 'glob' on tests/*.scr)

For every .scr file you put in tests, you must create the proper
.out and .err file with the following command

runscr file.scr > file.out 2> file.err
