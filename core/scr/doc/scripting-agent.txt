ScriptingAgent takes care of the mapping of paths to their respective agents.
It provides these commands:

* RegisterAgent (path, string|term)

Normally RegisterAgent is called for each *.scr file found in scrconf.
The second argument is the scr file.
Returns true.

* UnregisterAgent (path)

The agent is unmounted and unregistered.
Returns false if path not found, otherwise true.

* UnregisterAllAgents ()

All agents are unmounted and unregistered.
Useful for agent test suites.
Returns true.

* MountAgent (path)

Mounting an agent means reading its configuration term, loading the
component and passing it the term arguments as commands.
If the agent is mounted already, it is unmounted first.
Returns true on success.

* MountAllAgents ()

Mounts all registered agents.
Returns true.

* UnmountAgent (path)

Sends the agent a "result" command and removes the component form memory.
Returns false if path not found, otherwise true.

* UnmountAllAgents ()

Unmounts all mounted agents.
Returns true.
