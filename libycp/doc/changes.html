    <h1>Changes in the YCP grammar</h1>

In order to make the YCP syntax clearer and to reduce ambiguities in
the Yacc-grammar, some syntactical rules have been refined. This reduced
the number of conflicts reported by the parser generator from 146 to 2 (!)<br>
<p>

<h2>Double qoutes</h2>

The use of double qoutes (<tt><b>``</b></tt>) is somewhat restricted
now but does not reduce functionality as used by now.<br>
<p>
Double qoutes are only allowed for blocks (<tt><b>``{</b></tt> ... <tt><b>}</b></tt>),
expressions (<tt><b>``(</b></tt> ... <tt><b>)</b></tt>)
and terms (<tt><b>``</b><i>identifier</i><b>(</b></tt>  ... <tt><b>)</b></tt>).
<br>
There is no space allowed between the double qoute and the following symbol.
<br>

<p>
<h2>Map expressions</h2>

Map expressions are still defined by (<tt><b>$[</b></tt> ... <tt><b>]</b></tt>),
but <tt><b>$[</b></tt> is a single token now and must be written without space
inbetween.<br>

<p>
<h2>Expressions are no statements</h2>

There is a clear destinction now between expressions (having a value) and
statements (having a semantical meaning). In the old syntax expressions
could be used as statements. Since this make the syntax ambiguous and is
useless anyway, statements like <tt><b>1 + 1;</b></tt> are not allowed.<br>

<p>
<h2>Declaration is no value</h2>

The old syntax allowed declarations (type definitions) as values. However
this made the syntax highly ambiguous and accounted for most of the conflicts
reported by the parser generator. In fact this feature of a functional
language wasn't used, ycp usage is imperative.<br>
If values like <tt><b>[ integer, float ]</b></tt> (list of declarations) are
really needed, the syntax can be re-introduced into the grammar with some
'syntactical sugar' (a special keyword).
