- global define

   defines are local by default


- new keywords

   const, extends, component


- nil allowed for every value

   nil is handled internally as a special value.
   every variable can be assigned nil
   reading such a variable results in the default value defined
   for this type

   checking can be done with "is (symbol, type_declaration)" which
   is done without evaluating symbol

   see  tests/VoidAssign.ycp
