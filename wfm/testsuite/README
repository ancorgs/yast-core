wfm testsuite

The wfm testsuite test the libypc by running all .wfm files in
the wfm.test directory (wfm.test/*.wfm) through y2wfm.

Every run results in a stdout and stderr output which is
checked agains .out and .err respectively.

The file lib/wfm.exp defines a function which runs all tests
contained in wfm.test (i.e. makes a 'glob' on wfm.test/*.wfm)

For every .wfm file you put in tests, you must create the proper
.out and .err file with the following command

y2wfm < file.wfm > file.out 2> file.err
