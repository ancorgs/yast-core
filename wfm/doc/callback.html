<H1>Callback in WFM</H1>
<H2>Implementation issues for callbacks</H2>

<H3>Purpose</H3>
Get access to WFM and SCR functionality in UI code.<BR>
Read and write WFM scope variables.<BR>
Call WFM defined functions.<BR>
Use SCR agents.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Restrictions</H3>
Ensure proper return of original UI() call.<BR>
Check for (or block ?) reentrancy.<BR>
Don't use WFM if it can be done in UI().<BR>
Keep overhead (e.g. serial connection) in mind.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Implementation options</H3>
<UL>
<LI>return YCPCallback() value<BR>
will be tricky since we must re-enter UI after evaluating the
callback. Where and how do we re-enter at the correct point in code ?<BR>
mayba a __callback and __continue builtin could be used.</LI>
<LI>intercept component->evaluate()<BR>
This is basically the same.</LI>
<LI>open separate communication channel<BR>
might be cleanest solution but breaks horribly with the current
stdin/stdout concept.</LI>
<LI>_callback() builtin<BR>
similar to YCPCallback() value (with similar problems ...)<BR>
we need a 'backlink' in the component concept to pass values
back and forth between components. It is a <i>virtual</i> communication
channel.<BR>
Practically, this complete solution isn't needed since SCR does not
have an interpreter of it's own. So it is incapabable of issuing a callback.<BR>
This is only needed between UI (server) and WFM (client).<BR>
So only y2component::evaluate() is affected, not y2component::doActualWork() !!</LI>
<LI><b>callback() slot in Y2Component</b><br>
This is the only viable solution as it allows a transparent callback across
the component interface.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
<H3>Syntactical issues</H3>
First approach <TT>WFM(<i>wfm-code</i>)</TT> is bad because it will
lead to <TT>WFM(SCR(...))</TT>. Having WFM() is a good idea, but we
also need SCR() to make it transparent.<BR>
